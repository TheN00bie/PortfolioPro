# PortfolioPro
 A stock analysis streamlit dashboard

# Setting up : 

install the following dependencies:

- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- yfinance 
- plotly

run the app in via terminal with following command: 

`streamlit run App.py`

# Issues 

- The app is very experimental and is developed only for educational purposes and have many underlying static assumptions and is not suitable for real world trade analysis in the current state. 

- As of of now app only analyses one stock at a time , not a very good thing for a portfolio analytics app. But one workaround for now is launching multiple instances of it in multiple browser tabs.

for example: 

- the risk free for various calculations is a static `0` for now

# Plans :

- Improving the quant and mapm function for accurate analysis 
- Adding more functions like capm , sentiment analysis 
- Adding multi asset analysis for comparative and in depth analysis 
- and much more

# Setting up : 

install the following dependencies:

- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- yfinance 
- plotly

`streamlit run App.py`

# Issues 

- The app is very experimental and is developed only for educational purposes and have many underlying static assumptions and is not suitable for real world trade analysis in the current state. 

for example: 

- the risk free for various calculations is a static `0` for now

# Plans :

- Improving the quant and mapm function for accurate analysis 
- Adding more functions like capm , sentiment analysis 
- Adding multi asset analysis for comparative and in depth analysis 
- and much more
